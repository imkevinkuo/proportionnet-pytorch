# celis-fair-online-advertising-modified

This folder is a copy of the Fair-Online-Advertising code at https://github.com/AnayMehrotra/Fair-Online-Advertising. It has been modified to take the valuation distributions from ProportionNet Setting G as input; `celis-fair-online-advertising-modified/Webscope_A1/ydata-ysm-advertiser-bids-v1_0.txt` is our mock data from simulating the Setting G value distributions. The Yahoo! Webscope A1 data is not included with the code.
